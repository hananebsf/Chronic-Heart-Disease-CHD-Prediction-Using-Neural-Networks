# Chronic-Heart-Disease-CHD-Prediction-Using-Neural-Networks

## Overview

This project implements a Neural Network-based classification model using Keras to predict Chronic Heart Disease (CHD). The dataset is obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

The objective is to classify whether a patient has CHD based on medical attributes. The dataset contains 303 observations with 13 features and 1 target variable. The original target variable (num) has values 0-4, which are converted into a binary classification (absence or presence of CHD).

## Dataset

Source: UCI Heart Disease Dataset
Attributes: 13 features + 1 target variable
Target Label:
0 → No CHD
1-4 → Presence of CHD (converted into binary: 1)
